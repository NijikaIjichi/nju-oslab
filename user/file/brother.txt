You can lie to your brother, but don’t lie to yourself. It really doesn't matter if your brother was deceived by you, just hit haha ​​and it's over. But I hope you wipe the corners of your eyes after typing this sentence, and don't let the tears fall on the phone screen. Brother believe you will not lose a piece of meat, but you don't take it seriously yourself. It really doesn't matter if your buddy is deceived by you, and your brother's smile will pass. It's not that the buddy wants to break your defense, you wipe your tears and think about it, who will believe what you say except the bro?
